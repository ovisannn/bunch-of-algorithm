# Acceleration

## Introduction

> in general, Acceleration refers to speeding up. However, from the physics perspective, it is something different. In physics, it refers to as the rate at witch the changes of velocity of the object. it doesn't matter if it is speeding up or down. all it is matter is the changes

> Therefore, the acceleration is positive when the object is speeding up and negative when speeding down. According to Newtonâ€™s Second Law, the net unbalanced force which acts on the object causes this to happen. Thus, it can be said that acceleration is a vector quantity. It is so because it changes the time rate of change of velocity.

## Formula for Acceleration

>F = m . a

> F is the force, m is mass, a is acceleration
